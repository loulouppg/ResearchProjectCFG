          <h1>Attachment</h1>
           </div> 
           <h1>What is Attachment?</h1>
      <h2>Attachment is defined as a “lasting psychological connectedness between human beings” (Bowlby, 1969), and may be considered interchangeable with concepts such as “affectional bond” and “emotional bond.”
          A human being’s first attachment is often established during infancy with the primary caregiver; however, it must be noted that attachment is not unique to infant-caregiver relationships, but may also be present in other forms of social relationships.	
         	Attachments of various kinds are formed through the repeated act of “attachment behaviors” or “attachment transactions,” a continuing process of seeking and maintaining a certain level of proximity to another specified individual (Bowlby, 1969).
          Because caregivers vary in their levels of sensitivity and responsiveness, not all infants attach to caregivers in the same way.
        	Attachment styles are expectations people develop about relationships with others, based on the relationship they had with their primary caregiver when they were infants
         </h2>
         <h2> Based on the observations, behavior studies have sorted infants into three major groups</h2>
         <h1>Avoidant Attachment (Group A)</h1>
         <h3>Children with avoidant attachment styles tend to avoid interaction with the caregiver, and show no distress during separation. This may be because the parent has ignored attempts to be intimate, and the child may internalize the belief that they cannot depend on this or any other relationship.
          •	An infant in Group A was characterised as displaying little to no tendency of seeking proximity with the mother. The infant often showed no distress during separation with the mother, interacted with the stranger similarly to how he or she would interact with the mother, and showed slight signs of avoidance (turning away, avoiding eye contact, etc.) when reunited with the mother.
          •	 Group A infants’ interpreted avoidance behaviors as a defensive mechanism against the mothers’ own rejecting behaviors, such as being uncomfortable with physical contact or being more easily angered by the infants.
          </h3>
          <h1>•	Secure Attachment (Group B)</h1>
          <h3>•	Bowlby (1988) described secure attachment as the capacity to connect well and securely in relationships with others while also having the capacity for autonomous action as situationally appropriate. Secure attachment is characterised by trust, an adaptive response to being abandoned, and the belief that one is worthy of love.
            •	An infant in Group B was characterised as actively seeking and maintaining proximity with the mother, especially during the reunion episode. The infant may or may not be friendly with the stranger, but always-showed more interest in interacting with the mother.
            •	Additionally, while the infant tended to be slightly distressed during separation from the mother, the infant rarely cried.
            • Group B infants as interpreted as being securely attached to their mothers, showing less anxiousness and more positive attitudes toward the relationship, likely because they believe in their mothers’ responsiveness towards their needs.
            </h3>
            <h1>•	Ambivalent Attachment (Group C)</h1>
            <h3>Ambivalent attachment relationships are characterised by a concern that others will not reciprocate one's desire for intimacy. This is caused when an infant learns that their caregiver or parent is unreliable and does not consistently provide responsive care towards their needs.
              •	An infant in Group C was characterised as being somewhat ambivalent (and resistant) to the mother. The infant often demonstrated signs of resisting interactions with the mother, especially during the reunion episode.
              •	However, once contact with the mother was gained, the infant also showed strong intentions to maintain such contact. Overall, a Group C infant often seemed to display maladaptive behaviors throughout the Strange Situation. 
              •	Observations found Group C infants to be anxious and unconfident about their mothers’ responsiveness, as the Group C infants’ mothers were observed to lack “the fine sense of timing” in responding to the infants’ needs.
              </h3>
              <h1>•	Disorganized Attachment (Group D)</h1>
              <h3>•	Main and Solomon (1986) discovered that a sizable proportion of infants actually did not fit into Groups A, B, or C, based on their behaviors in the Strange Situation experiment. They categorized these infants as Group D, disorganized attachment type.
                •	Disorganised attachment is classified by children who display sequences of behaviors that lack readily observable goals or intentions, including obviously contradictory behaviors or stilling/freezing of movements.
                •	Main and Solomon found that the parents of Group D infants often had unresolved attachment-related traumas, which caused the parents to display either frightened or frightening behaviors, in turn resulting in the Group D infants to be confused or forcing them to rely on someone that they were afraid of at the same time.
