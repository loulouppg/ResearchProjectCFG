       <div class="Title"> <h1>Prenatal brain development</h1></div>
       <div class="Texty">
         <h3><p>The human brain is a fascinating and complicated organ.</p> 
        <p>The growth of its intricate structure begins soon after conception and continues through many critical periods of development during the first seven months of pregnancy.
        Prenatal development can be divided into three stages:</p>
        <p>The germinal stage (fertilisation to about 2 weeks)</p>
        <p>The embryonic stage (from the second to eighth week)</p>
        <p>The foetal stage (from the ninth week until birth).</p>
        
        <p>The germinal stage begins at conception when the
        sperm cell successfully enters the ovum and fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube. </p>
        This results in the creation of a Zygote, which contains the combined genetic material from both male and female partners (23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm). Through the process of cell division (mitosis), the zygote starts to divide, creating a cluster of cells called a Morula. At this stage, cell division continues at a rapid rate as the cells develop into a blastocyst. The inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst consists of stem cells, which differentiate to create three germ layers:
        
     <p> <li> The ectoderm (which will become the skin and nervous system).
      </li> 

      <li> The mesoderm (which will become the muscle and skeletal systems).</li>

      <li> The endoderm (which will become the digestive and respiratory systems). 
      </li></p>

        
       <p> The blastocyst continues to travel towards the uterus and embeds into the uterine wall, a process
        known as implantation.</h3></p>

    <div class="Title"> <h1>The formation of the neural tube</h1> </div>
    <div class="Texty"><p><h3>Brain development begins with the formation and closure of the neural tube. </p>
       <p> The neural tube develops from the neural plate, which begins forming 16 days after conception. </p>
        <p>S plate lengthens and starts folding up to form a neural crest created around a shallow neural
         groove, which then begins to close into a tube. </p>The neural tube is fully closed around 25 days
         ter conception and has already begun its transformation into the brain and spinal cord of the 
         embryo. It is interesting to note that the brain develops from the bottom up, which is the reverse 
         of the physical development process that occurs after birth.</h3>
