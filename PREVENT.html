        <h>What is the PREVENT Duty?</h>

‘The Prevent duty, is the duty in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 on specified authorities, in the exercise of their functions, to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism.’ (Department for Education, 2015) 

The Home Office defines radicalisation as ‘the process by which a person comes to support terrorism and ​extremist ideologies associated with terrorist groups’​ (Revised Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales, issued on 12th March 2015 and revised on 16th July 2015, definition). 

 

Early Years practitioners all have a responsibility to promote British Values  

These are; 

Democracy 

Rule of Law 

Individual Liberty 

Mutual Respect and Tolerance  

Whilst these might seem to be complex ideas for small children, they are addressed through the everyday practice of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). The government guidance on what is expected can be found here;  

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protecting-children-from-radicalisation-the-prevent-duty  

There are a whole range of examples of extremism and it is important as practitioners that we do not stereotype or assume that a particular group is more likely to be vulnerable to radicalisation. Examples of extremism may include groups with extreme political views such as far right groups, animal rights groups, environmental extremism, and religious extremism.  

 

If you are worried or concerned about someone you know you should speak to a teacher or Student Services if you are  a student in College or your Prevent Co-ordinator in your workplace, or ​Sadia Hussain​ PREVENT Coordinator at Calderdale Council 

 

Each Local Authority will have their own PREVENT Coordinator, and you should be able to find the details of them on the internet.
